shall have, during Buyer's Due Diligence as referenced in Section 8.1, an opportunity to completely inspect and evaluate the condition of
the Property; and (c) if based on the Buyer's Due Diligence, Buyer elects to proceed with the purchase of the Property, Buyer is relying
wholly on Buyer's own judgment and that of any contractors or inspectors engaged by Buyer to review, evaluate and inspect the Property.

11.  FINAL PRE-SETTLEMENT WALK-THROUGH INSPECTION. No earlier than seven (7) calendar days prior to Settlement, and upon
reasonable notice and at a reasonable time, Buyer may conduct a final pre-Settlement walk-through inspection of the Property to
determine only that the Property is "as represented," meaning that the items referenced in Sections 1.1, 1.2 and 8.1(b)(ii) ("the items") are
respectively present, repaired or corrected as agreed. The failure to conduct a walk-through inspection or to claim that an item is not as
represented shall not constitute a waiver by Buyer of the right to receive, on the date of possession, the items as represented.

the date of Closing the following additional items apply:

MAY NOT after the Seller Disclosure Deadline continue to accept short-term rental bookings for guest use of the property without the prior

13.  AUTHORITY OF SIGNERS. If Buyer or Seller is a corporation, partnership, trust, estate, limited liability company or other entity, the
person signing the REPC on its behalf warrants his or her authority to do so and to bind Buyer and Seller.
 
14.  COMPLETE CONTRACT. The REPC together with its addenda, any attached exhibits, and Seller Disclosures (collectively referred to
as the "REPC"), constitutes the entire contract between the parties and supersedes and replaces any and all prior negotiations,
representations, warranties, understandings or contracts between the parties whether verbal or otherwise. The REPC cannot be changed
except by written agreement of the parties.
 
15.  MEDIATION. Any dispute relating to the REPC arising prior to or after Closing: [  ] SHALL [  ] MAY AT THE OPTION OF THE
PARTIES first be submitted to mediation. Mediation is a process in which the parties meet with an impartial person who helps to resolve
the dispute informally and confidentially. Mediators cannot impose binding decisions. The parties to the dispute must agree before any
settlement is binding. The parties will jointly appoint an acceptable mediator and share equally in the cost of such mediation. If mediation
fails, the other procedures and remedies available under the REPC shall apply. Nothing in this Section 15 prohibits any party from
seeking emergency legal or equitable relief, pending mediation. The provisions of this Section 15 shall survive Closing.
 
16.  DEFAULT.
    16.1  Buyer Default. If Buyer defaults, Seller may elect one of the following remedies: (a) cancel the REPC and retain the Earnest
Money Deposit, or Deposits, if applicable, as liquidated damages; (b) maintain the Earnest Money Deposit, or Deposits, if applicable, in
trust and sue Buyer to specifically enforce the REPC; or (c) return the Earnest Money Deposit, or Deposits, if applicable, to Buyer and
pursue any other remedies available at law.
    16.2  Seller Default. If Seller defaults, Buyer may elect one of the following remedies: (a) cancel the REPC, and in addition to the return
of the Earnest Money Deposit, or Deposits, if applicable, Buyer may elect to accept from Seller, as liquidated damages, a sum equal to
the Earnest Money Deposit, or Deposits, if applicable; or (b) maintain the Earnest Money Deposit, or Deposits, if applicable, in trust and
sue Seller to specifically enforce the REPC; or (c) accept a return of the Earnest Money Deposit, or Deposits, if applicable, and pursue
any other remedies available at law. If Buyer elects to accept liquidated damages, Seller agrees to pay the liquidated damages to Buyer
upon demand.
 
17.  ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS/GOVERNING LAW. In the event of litigation or binding arbitration arising out of the transaction
contemplated by the REPC, the prevailing party shall be entitled to costs and reasonable attorney fees. However, attorney fees shall not
be awarded for participation in mediation under Section 15. This contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Utah. The provisions of this Section 17 shall survive Closing.
 
18.  NOTICES. Except as provided in Section 23, all notices required under the REPC must be: (a) in writing; (b) signed by the Buyer or
Seller giving notice; and (c) received by the Buyer or the Seller, or their respective agent, or by the brokerage firm representing the Buyer
or Seller, no later than the applicable date referenced in the REPC.
 
19.  NO ASSIGNMENT.  The REPC and the rights and obligations of Buyer hereunder, are personal to Buyer. The REPC may not be
assigned by Buyer without the prior written consent of Seller. Provided, however, the transfer of Buyer's interest in the REPC to any
business entity in which Buyer holds a legal interest, including, but not limited to, a family partnership, family trust, limited liability
company, partnership, or corporation (collectively referred to as a "Permissible Transfer"), shall not be treated as an assignment by Buyer
that requires Seller's prior written consent. Furthermore, the inclusion of "and/or assigns" or similar language on the line identifying Buyer
on the first page of the REPC shall constitute Seller's written consent only to a Permissible Transfer.
 
20.  INSURANCE & RISK OF LOSS.
    20.1  Insurance Coverage. As of Closing, Buyer shall be responsible to obtain casualty and liability insurance coverage on the Property
in amounts acceptable to Buyer and Buyer's Lender, if applicable.
    20.2  Risk of Loss. If prior to Closing, any part of the Property is damaged or destroyed by fire, vandalism, flood, earthquake, or act of
God, the risk of such loss or damage shall be borne by Seller; provided however, that if the cost of repairing such loss or damage would
exceed ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price referenced in Section 2, either Seller or Buyer may elect to cancel the REPC by
providing written notice to the other party, in which instance the Earnest Money Deposit, or Deposits, if applicable, shall be returned to
Buyer.
 
21.  TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. Time is of the essence regarding the dates set forth in the REPC. Extensions must be agreed to in
writing by all parties. Unless otherwise explicitly stated in the REPC: (a) performance under each Section of the REPC which references
a date shall absolutely be required by 5:00 PM Mountain Time on the stated date; and (b) the term "days" and "calendar days" shall mean
calendar days and shall be counted beginning on the day following the event which triggers the timing requirement (e.g. Acceptance).
Performance dates and times referenced herein shall not be binding upon title companies, lenders, appraisers and others not parties to
the REPC, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by such non-party.
 
22.  ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION AND COUNTERPARTS.  The REPC may be executed in counterparts. Signatures on any of the
Documents, whether executed physically or by use of electronic signatures, shall be deemed original signatures and shall have the same
