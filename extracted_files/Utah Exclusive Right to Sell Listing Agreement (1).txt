5.   AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS.  
 5.1 Duties of a Seller’s Agent. By signing this Listing Agreement, the Seller designates the Seller’s 
Agent and the Principal/Branch Broker for the Company (the “Broker”), as agents for the Seller to locate a 
buyer for the Property. The Seller authorizes the Seller’s Agent or the Broker to appoint another agent in the 
Company to also represent the Seller in the event the Seller’s Agent or the Broker will be unavailable to service 
the Seller. As agents for the Seller, they have fiduciary duties to the Seller that include loyalty, obedience, full 
disclosure, confidentiality, reasonable care, and any other duties required by law.  
 5.2 Duties of a Limited Agent. The Seller understands that the Seller’s Agent and the Broker may 
now, or in the future, be agents for a buyer who may wish to negotiate a purchase of the Property. Then the 
Seller’s Agent and the Broker may be acting as Limited Agents - representing both the Seller and buyer at the 
same time. A Limited Agent has fiduciary duties to both the Seller and the buyer as required by law. However, 
some of those duties are “limited” because the agent cannot provide to both parties undivided loyalty, 
confidentiality and disclosure. For this reason, the Limited Agent is bound by a further duty of neutrality. Being 
neutral, the Limited Agent may not disclose to either party information likely to weaken the bargaining position 
of the other – for example, the highest price the buyer will offer, or the lowest price the Seller will accept. 
However, the Limited Agent will be required to disclose information given to the agent in confidence by the 
other party if failure to disclose such information would be a material misrepresentation regarding the Property 
or regarding the ability of the parties to fulfill their obligations. The Seller is advised that neither the Seller nor 
the buyer is required to accept a limited agency situation in the Company, and each party is entitled to be 
represented by its own agent. In the event a limited agency situation arises, the Seller’s Agent and the Broker, 
as applicable, may only act as Limited Agents based upon a separate Limited Agency Consent Agreement 
signed by the Seller and buyer.   
 
6.  PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.   The Company and the Seller’s Agent are trained in the marketing of real 
estate. Neither the Company nor its agents are trained or licensed to provide the Seller or any prospective 
buyer with legal or tax advice, or with technical advice regarding the physical condition of the Property. The 
Seller is advised not to rely on the Company, or any agents of the Company, for a determination regarding the 
physical or legal condition of the Property. If the Seller desires advice regarding:  (a) Past or present 
compliance with zoning and building code requirements; (b) Legal or tax matters; (c) The physical condition of 
the Property; (d) This Listing Agreement; or (e) Any transaction for the acquisition of the Property, the Seller's 
Agent and the Company strongly recommend that the Seller obtain such independent advice. If the Seller fails 
to do so, the Seller is acting contrary to the advice of the Company. Any recommendations for third-party 
services made by the Company or the Seller’s Agent do not guarantee the Seller’s satisfaction in the use of 
those third-party services and should not be seen as a warranty of any kind as to the level of service that will 
be provided by the third parties.  The Seller is advised that it is up to the Seller in the Seller’s sole discretion to 
choose third-party services that meet the needs of the Seller and not to rely on any recommendations given by 
the Company or the Seller’s Agent.  
 
7.   DISPUTE RESOLUTION. The parties agree that any dispute, arising prior to or after a Closing, related 
to this Listing Agreement shall first be submitted to mediation through a mediation provider mutually agreed 
upon by the Seller and the Company. Each party agrees to bear its own costs of mediation. If mediation fails, 
any other remedies available at law shall apply.  
 
8.   ATTORNEY FEES/GOVERNING LAW. Except as provided in Section 7, in case of the employment of 
an attorney in any matter arising out of this Listing Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive 
from the other party all costs and attorney fees, whether the matter is resolved through court action or 
otherwise. If, through no fault of the Company, any litigation arises out of the Seller's employment of the 
Company under this Listing Agreement (whether before or after a Closing), the Seller agrees to indemnify the 
Company and the Seller's Agent from all costs and attorney fees incurred by the Company and/or the Seller's 
Agent in pursuing and/or defending such action. This Listing Agreement shall be governed and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of Utah.  
 
9.  ADVERTISING/SELLER AUTHORIZATIONS.  The Seller authorizes the Company and the Seller’s 
Agent to advertise the Property for sale through any printed and/or electronic media deemed necessary and 
appropriate by the Seller’s Agent and the Company, including, but not limited to, each Multiple Listing Service 
(MLS) in which the Company participates. The Seller agrees that any advertising the Seller intends to conduct, 
including print and/or electronic media, shall first be approved in writing by the Seller’s Agent. The Seller 
further agrees that the Seller’s Agent and the Company are authorized to:

(d) Have keys to the Property, if applicable;

Property. If the Seller authorizes the Broker, or Seller’s Agent, to install a non-MLS or local board of 
Realtors® approved/endorsed  security key-box on the Property, Seller acknowledges that it may 
not provide the same level of security as  the MLS or local board of Realtors® 
approved/endorsed security key-box; 

(f) Hold Open-Houses at the Property; 
(g) Place for sale, sold, or other similar signs (“Signs”) on the Property (i.e., the only Signs on the 

Property shall be that of the Company); 
(h) Order a Preliminary Title Report on the Property; 
(i) Order a Home Warranty Plan, if applicable; 
(j) Communicate with the Seller for the purpose of soliciting real estate related goods and services 

during and after the term of this Listing Agreement; and 
(k) Place the Earnest Money Deposit into an interest-bearing trust account with interest paid to the 

Utah Association of Realtors® Housing Opportunity Fund (UARHOF) to assist in creating affordable 
housing throughout the state.  

 
10. PERSONAL PROPERTY. The Seller acknowledges that the Company has discussed with the Seller 
the safeguarding of personal property and valuables located within the Property. The Seller acknowledges that 
the Company is not an insurer against the loss of or damage to personal property. The Seller agrees to hold 
the Company harmless from any loss or damage that might result from any authorizations given in Section 9.   
 
11.    ATTACHMENT.  The Data Form is incorporated into this Listing Agreement by this reference. In 
addition to the Data Form, there [    ] ARE [    ] ARE NOT additional terms contained in an Addendum attached 
to this Listing Agreement. If an Addendum is attached, the terms of that Addendum are incorporated into this 
Listing Agreement by this reference. 
 
12. FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN REAL PROPERTY TAX ACT (“FIRPTA”). The sale or other disposition of a 
U.S. real property interest by a foreign person is subject to income tax withholding under FIRPTA.  A “foreign 
person” may include a non-resident alien individual, foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust and 
foreign estate. Seller warrants and represents to the Company and to the Seller’s Agent, that Seller [    ] IS       
[    ] IS NOT a “foreign person” as defined in Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code and its associated 
regulations. If Seller is not a foreign person, Seller agrees, upon request, to deliver a certification to Buyer at 
closing, stating that Seller is not a foreign person.  This certification shall be in the form then required by 
FIRPTA.  If FIRPTA applies to you as Seller, you are advised that the Buyer or other qualified substitute may 
be legally required to withhold 10% of the total purchase price for the Property at closing and remit that amount 
to the IRS. If Seller is a foreign person as defined above, and Seller does not have a US Taxpayer 
Identification number, Seller agrees to prepare to apply for a US Taxpayer Identification number. 
 
13.   EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY. The Seller and the Company shall comply with Federal, State, 
and local fair housing laws.  
  
14.   ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION & COUNTERPARTS. Electronic transmission (including email and 
fax) of a signed copy of this Listing Agreement and any addenda, and the retransmission of any signed 
electronic transmission, shall be the same as delivery of an original. This Listing Agreement and any addenda 
may be executed in counterparts.  
 
15. DUE-ON-SALE. Certain types of transactions may trigger what is commonly referred to as a “due-on-
sale” clause. A “due-on-sale” clause typically states that the Seller’s lender or mortgagee may call the loan due 
and payable in full if the Seller participates in certain types of transactions. These types of transactions may 
include, but are not limited to, transactions where: (a) The sale of the property does not result in the underlying 
debt being paid in full; (b) The parties enter into a seller-financed transaction; (c) A lease option agreement is

entered into; or (d) Any other unauthorized transfer of title to the Property has occurred without the lender’s 
consent. The Seller understands that if any underlying encumbrances or mortgages on the Property contain a 
“due-on-sale clause,” and the “due-on-sale” clause is triggered, the lender may call the entire unpaid balance 
of the loan immediately due.  
 
16.    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Listing Agreement, including the Seller's Property Condition Disclosure 
form and the Data Form, contain the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter of this
