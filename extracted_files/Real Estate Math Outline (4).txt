Arti Academics Math Study Guide 
 
 
Introduction 
A Real Estate Agent needs to have strong math skills to be successful. They need to be able to 
calculate commissions, estimate property taxes, and keep track of their finances. They also need to 
be able to negotiate with buyers and sellers and understand the market.  
 
Key Terms and Formulas  
 
Loan to Value - 
 

Definition  
Loan to value ratio (LTV) is a financial term used to express the ratio of the amount 
borrowed to the value of a real estate asset. The property value is usually determined by an 
appraisal.  
 
Calculating Loan to Value 
LTV = Mortgage Amount / Property Value 

 
Example Problem 
If you have a mortgage amount of $500,000 and the appraised property value is 525,000 
then your LTV would be: 500,000/525,000 or .95%  
 

Mortgages & Basic Interest - 
 

Definition  
Basic Interest is the cost of borrowing money and is typically expressed as a percentage of 
the principal loan amount.  
 
Calculating Basic Interest  
A = P(1 + rt) A is the final amount, P is the initial balance, r is the rate and t is the time  
in years.  
 
Example Problem 
If you borrowed 500,000 at 6% for 15 years your final amount would be A = 
$500,000(1+.06*15) or $950,000  
 
Now we find the Interest and the Principal in the payment. Take the loan amount at 
500,000 and multiple by interest of .06 = 30,000 / 12 months = $2,500 - $2,997.75 = 
$497.75 This shows that month one interest is $2,500 and principal is $497.75

PITI  
A mortgage will typically include Principal, interest, taxes, and Insurance.   
 
Amortization 
Mortgage Amortization is the process of spreading out the cost of a property over its useful 
life. This is usually done through periodic payments, such as monthly or yearly payments.  
 
Per Annum  
Per Annum means once per year  
 
Example - A 5% per annum interest rate on a $500,000 dollar loan would cost $25,000 per 
year. (500000*.05).  
 

Settlement & Closing Cost - 
 

Definition  
Fees that the buyer and/or seller pay to complete the sale of a property.  
 
Closing cost are typically between 2%-5%   
 

Prorations - 
 

Definition  
A proration is when a seller and buyer of a property agree to split the cost of something 
based on the time each owned the property.   
 
Calculating Prorations  
Property Taxes for a property are $1,000 for the year and the seller owned the property for 
six months and the buyer owned it for six months, the seller would pay $500 of the taxes 
and the buyer would pay $500.  
 
Example Problem 
Harold is selling a house and John is purchasing it. For the year, property taxes of $2,500 
were already paid by Harold. Harold has owned the home for 120 days this year. John will 
own the home for 245 days. How much should money Harold get back at closing? Harold 
will receive $1678.08 at closing. Step one 245/365 = .67 Step 2 .67*2500=1678.08

Transfer Tax - 
 

Definition  
This is a tax by local or state government to complete a sale of property from one owner to 
another. Depending on the state or jurisdiction, the transfer tax fees can vary but are 
typically a percentage of the sales price.  
 
Calculation  
It is calculated as a percentage of the sale price or appraised value of the property being 
sold. It depends on the state, city, and county of the property is being sold in.  
 

Pre-Payment-Penalty - 
 

Definition  
A fee that is charged by some lenders for if you pay the loan off before the term of the loan 
has expired. This is typically used to pay the lender additional money if the property is sold 
within the first few years. Most often these are applicable to commercial or investment 
loans. They are not as common on residential loans.  
 
Calculating Pre Payment-Penalty  
A typical Pre-payment structure is a 5-4-3-2-1 meaning if the loan is paid off in the first 
year the penalty is 5% of the loan value. If it is paid off in the second year the penalty is 4% 
of the loan value and so on. In this example, in year 5, there is no prepayment penalty.  
 
Example Problem 
You took out a loan for $500,000 dollars and you wish to pay it off in year 3 and you have 
paid down the loan $150,000 dollars how much is the Pre-payment Penalty? $500,000 - 
$150,000 = $350,000 *.03 = $10,500 of prepayment penalty for a total of $360,500 to pay 
off the loan 
 

Discount Points on Loan - 
 

Definition  
Discount points are a fee paid by the borrower to the lender at closing to lower the interest 
rate on the loan. Generally, one point lowers your rate .0125-.025 or 1/8-1/4 of a percent.  
 
Calculating Discount Points  
Discount points are calculated as a percentage of the loan amount. Each point is one 
percent of the total amount borrowed. On a 500,000 dollar loan if you wanted to buy down 
one point it would be $500,000 * .01 or 1% which is $5000. So, for every point buy down it 
would cost $5000 dollars.

Example Problem 
A borrower is considering taking out a 500,000-dollar loan. The lender is offering the 
borrower the option to purchase discount points to reduce the interest rate on the loan. 
How many discount points must the borrower purchase to reduce the interest rate by 1%, If 
we assume each point buys down .025%? $500,000 *.01 = $5000 so each .25% rate 
reduction will cost $5,000 and we need 1%. 1/.25 = 4 so we need $5,000 * 4 = $20,000 to 
get 1% lower interest rate.  

 
Loss or Gain on Property - 
 

Definition  
Loss or gain is the amount of money you made or lost at the time of selling the property.  
 
Calculating Loss or Gain on Property  
Start with the purchase price of the asset - the depreciation + improvements then subtract 
that from the purchase price if it is positive, you have gain if it is negative, you have loss.  
 
Example Problem 
You bought a home for $500,000 and in 15 years you sold it for $750,000, over those 15 
years you put $35,0000 in to fix it up and it has depreciated about $30,000. So, the total 
purchase price becomes $500,000 - $30,000 + $20,000 = $750,000 - $490,000 = 
$260,000 in profit. 
 

Gross Leasable Area - 
 

Definition  
Gross leasable area (GLA) is the amount of space in a commercial building that is available 
for lease to tenants. This includes both the usable square footage of the space, as well as 
common areas such as hallways and restrooms. The amount of GLA will vary significantly 
from one building to another and is typically larger in office buildings than in retail 
establishments.  
 
Calculation  
Simply add the total square feet available for lease.  
 
Example Problem 
Jon and Barry have two commercial suites for rent. Suite 1 is 3,900 square feet and Suite 2 
is 12,000 square feet. What is the gross leasable area? Answer: The gross leasable area is 
15,900 square feet. (3900 + 12000 = 15,900).  
 
For more information refer to the commercial real estate leasing course at ARTI(r) 
Academics.

Net Operating Income - 
 

Definition  
After subtracting necessary operating expenses, the net operating income is used to 
determine the revenue and profitability of an investment.  
 
Calculating Net Operation Income  
All revenue – all operating expenses as necessary  
 
Example Problem 
If your investment had a revenue of $5,000 a month and the expenses were $1,800 a 
month what is your NOI over the year? $5,000 * 12 = $60,000 - $1,800 * 12 = $21,600 so 
our NOI is $60,000 - $21,600 = $39,400  
 

Capitalization Rate - 
 

Definition  
Used in commercial real estate to indicate the rate of return that would be expected or 
generated on a real estate investment property. It gauges the risk and potential return on 
the property. Cap rates can vary from less than 4% to greater than 10% depending on the 
current real estate market dynamics.  
 
Calculating Capitalization Rate  
Start with finding the net income which is Gross Revenue – Total Expenses. Then divide the 
net income by the purchase price. Then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.  
 
Example Problem 
You bought a piece of property for $1,000,000 and the estimated gross income is $75,000 
and expenses of $10,000. The net income becomes $75,000 - $10,000 = $65,000 now 
divide $65,000/$1,000,000 = .065 * 100 = 6.5% capitalization rate.  
 

Depreciation - 
 

Definition  
Depreciation is an accounting method that allows a company to spread the cost of a 
purchase over the useful life of the asset. This method is often used for large purchases, 
such as buildings or equipment, that will be used for several years.   
 
Calculating Depreciation  
Divide the property value by the life of the property or useful life. For commercial real estate 
the useful life is 39 years. For residential real estate the useful life is 27.5 years.

ARTIAcademics.com

Example Problem 
We purchase a home that we rent for $500,000 with a useful life of 39 years. We would take 
$500,000 / 39 = $12,820.51 depreciation each year.  
 

Capitalization Rate - 
 

Definition  
Generally, real estate agents receive a commission from the seller, which is often a 
percentage of the final sale price of the home.  
 
Calculating Capitalization Rate  
Take the total sales price of the property and divide it by the commission amount.  
 
Example Problem 
Larry is a Real Estate Agent representing Paul to sell his home. Paul agreed to pay Larry’s 
Brokerage 6% of the sales price for the service. Another agent represented the Buyer and 
received 50% of the total commission. Larry sold Paul’s home for $280,000. How much 
revenue does Larry’s Brokerage earn on the transaction? Larry’s Brokerage earns $8,400. 
(280,000 * (.06 - .03) = $8,400)  
 

Decimals, Percentages, Fractions - 
 

Definition  
Decimal is a tenth part or power of tens.   
Percentage is a rate or portion of 100.  
Fractions represents a part or portion of a whole.  
 
Examples  
¼ = .25 = 25%   
1/3 = .33 = 33.33%  
½ = .50 = 50%  
1/8 = .125 = 12.5%

Land Area Calculations  
 
Calculate Square Feet - 
 

Definition  
Is a unit of area that is equal to 1 foot by 1 foot. 
 
Calculating Square Footage   
It is calculated by taking the Length and the width and multiplying them. L x W  
 
Example Problems 
If you have a room that is 14.7 ft by 25 ft what is the square footage? 14.7* 25 = 365.7 square feet  
 
If you have a property that is 500ft by 357 ft what is the square footage? 500 * 357 = 178,500 square 
feet  
 

Calculate Acreage – 
 

Definition  
An acre is a unit of measurement equaling 43,560 square feet. One acre is 208ft by 208ft square.  
 
Calculating Acreage  
This can be done multiple ways depending on what information you have. If you have the length (L) 
and width (W) of the property, you can multiple L X W then you would divide by 43560 Square feet.   
 
Take the square feet and simply divide by 43560 to get the acreage.  
 
Example Problems 
If the length of the property is 750 and the width is 1000 what is the acreage? 750 * 1000 = 750,000 
square feet. Divide 750,000 by 43560 = 17.22 acres  
 
If the square footage is 7600 what is the acreage? 43560 / 7600 = .17 acres  
 

Calculating a Section - 
 

Definition  
A section is a unit of measurement in the Public Land Surveying System commonly equaling 640 
acres.  
 
Calculating a section  
Simply divide the number of acres using your calculator by the section size, typically 640 acres, to 
return the number of sections. Similarly, you can multiply the number of Sections by 640 to return 
the number of acres.  
 
Example Problem 
I own 2.5 sections of land. How many total acres do I have? = 640 + 640 + 320 or 1600 Acres. 
Calculated differently 2.5*640 = 1600 Acres
