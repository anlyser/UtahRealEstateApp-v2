"walk-through" inspection of the Residence. If, as of Settlement, minor work remains to be completed, corrected or 
replaced on the Residence, then Buyer, pending completion of such work, may withhold in escrow at Settlement, a 
reasonable amount agreed to by Seller, Buyer and mortgage lenders , if applicable, sufficient to pay for completion of 
such work.  If such work is not completed within [  ] 30 DAYS [  ]   DAYS after Settlement, the amount so escrowed 
may, at Buyer's option, be released to Buyer as liquidated and agreed damages for failure to complete. The failure of 
Buyer to conduct a walk-through inspection prior to Settlement shall not constitute a waiver by Buyer of the right to receive 
on the date of possession, the Property as required under the REPC. 
 12.2 Substantial Completion. The Residence shall be considered "Substantially Complete" when occupancy of the 
Residence is allowable under the rules, ordinances and laws of the appropriate civil jurisdiction in which the Residence is 
located. In the absence of such governmental regulations, Substantial Completion shall be when the Residence is ready 
for occupancy and only minor work remains to be completed, corrected or replaced. Subject to the exceptions referenced 
in Section 13, the Substantial Completion Deadline shall be as referenced in Section 24(e). Seller shall provide Buyer 
written notice of Substantial Completion of the Residence. Change Orders may extend the Substantial Completion 
Deadline.   
 12.3 Construction Access. Buyer agrees that during the period of construction Seller shall have the unrestricted right 
to access the Property for the purpose of construction of the Residence and any necessary subdivision improvements if 
applicable.  Buyer shall have the right to reasonable inspection of the Property.  However, Seller reserves the right to limit 
Buyer's inspection of the Property in order to not hinder, interfere, or delay the work.  Buyer assumes all risks and liability 
associated with all such inspections. 
 12.4 Construction Compliance. Construction of the Residence shall be in accordance with the standards and 
requirements of all applicable Federal, State, and Local governmental laws, ordinances and regulations, and in 
compliance with restrictive covenants applicable to the Lot.  The Residence shall be correctly situated on the Lot. 
Construction shall also be done in accordance with the site plan as previously agreed to by Seller and Buyer.  
 12.5. Regulatory Changes.  If any regulatory requirements for construction of the Residence change during the 
course of construction and result in an increase in the costs of labor and/or materials, the Seller reserves the right to 
adjust the Purchase Price for the Property to correspond with such regulatory changes. In such event, the Seller shall 
provide the Buyer with a specific description of the regulatory change(s) and an itemization of the costs incurred to comply 
with the change(s).  
 
13. UNAVOIDABLE DELAY. In the event the Residence is not Substantially Complete by the Substantial Completion 
Deadline as referenced in Section 24(e) due to interruption of transport, availability of materials, strikes, fire, flood, 
weather, governmental regulations, acts of God, or similar occurrences beyond the control of the Seller, the Substantial 
Completion Deadline shall be extended for a reasonable period based on the nature of the delay.  In such event, the 
Seller shall notify the Buyer of the delay.     
 
14.  AUTHORITY OF SIGNERS.  If Buyer or Seller is a corporation, partnership, trust, estate, limited liability company, or 
other entity, the person executing the REPC on its behalf warrants his or her authority to do so and to bind Buyer and 
Seller. 
 
15.  COMPLETE CONTRACT.  The REPC together with its addenda, any attached exhibits, and Seller Disclosures, 
constitutes the entire contract between the parties and supersedes and replaces any and all prior negotiations, 
representations, warranties, understandings or contracts between the parties.  The REPC cannot be changed except by 
written agreement of the parties. 
 
16.  MEDIATION.   Any dispute relating to the REPC arising prior to or after Closing: [  ] SHALL [  ] MAY AT THE 
OPTION OF THE PARTIES first be submitted to mediation.  Mediation is a process in which the parties meet with an 
impartial person who helps to resolve the dispute informally and confidentially. Mediators cannot impose binding 
decisions. The parties to the dispute must agree before any settlement is binding. The parties will jointly appoint an 
acceptable mediator and share equally in the cost of such mediation. If mediation fails, the other procedures and 
remedies available under the REPC shall apply. Nothing in this Section 16 prohibits any party from seeking emergency 
legal or equitable relief, pending mediation. The provisions of this Section 16 shall survive Closing. 
 
17.  DEFAULT. 
 17.1 Buyer Default.  If Buyer defaults, Seller may elect one of the following remedies: (a) cancel the REPC and 
retain the Earnest Money Deposit and the Construction Deposit, if applicable, as liquidated damages; (b) maintain the 
 Earnest Money Deposit in trust, retain the Construction Deposit if applicable, and sue Buyer to specifically enforce the 
REPC; or (c) return the Earnest Money Deposit to Buyer, retain the Construction Deposit and pursue any other remedies 
available at law.

17.2 Seller Default.  If Seller defaults, Buyer may elect one of the following remedies: (a) cancel the REPC, and in 
addition to the return of the Earnest Money Deposit and the Construction Deposit if applicable, Buyer may elect to accept 
from Seller, as liquidated damages, a sum equal to the Earnest Money Deposit; or (b) maintain the Earnest Money 
Deposit in trust and sue Seller to specifically enforce the REPC; or (c) accept a return of the Earnest Money Deposit and 
Construction Deposit, if applicable, and pursue any other remedies available at law. If Buyer elects to accept liquidated 
damages, Seller agrees to pay the liquidated damages to Buyer upon demand.  
 
18. ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS/GOVERNING LAW.  In the event of litigation or binding arbitration to enforce the 
REPC, the prevailing party shall be entitled to costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in the litigation and/or 
arbitration. However, attorney fees shall not be awarded for participation in mediation under Section 16. The REPC shall 
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah. The provisions of this Section 18 shall 
survive Closing. 
 
19. NOTICES.  Except as provided in Section 25, all notices required under the REPC must be:  (a) in writing; (b) signed 
by the Buyer or Seller giving notice; and (c) received by the Buyer or the Seller, or their respective agent, or by the 
brokerage firm representing the Buyer or Seller, no later than the applicable date referenced in the REPC.  
 
20.  NO ASSIGNMENT.  The REPC and the rights and obligations of Buyer and Seller hereunder, are personal to Buyer 
and Seller. The REPC may not be assigned by Buyer or Seller without the prior written consent of the other party. 
Provided, however, the transfer of Buyer’s interest in the REPC to any business entity in which Buyer holds a legal 
interest, including, but not limited to, a family partnership, family trust, limited liability company, partnership, or corporation 
(collectively referred to as a “Permissible Transfer”), shall not be treated as an assignment by Buyer that requires Seller’s 
prior written consent. Furthermore, the inclusion of “and/or assigns” or similar language on the line identifying Buyer on 
the first page of the REPC shall constitute Seller’s written consent only to a Permissible Transfer.  
 
21. INSURANCE & RISK OF LOSS 
 21.1 INSURANCE.  During the period of construction and until Closing, the Seller shall maintain in full force and 
effect, at the Seller's expense, a builders risk insurance policy for the full replacement value of all completed portions of 
improvements included in the Residence; and all construction materials located on-site; workmen's compensation 
insurance in accordance with Utah law, and public general liability insurance in an amount not less than [  ] $1,000,000   
[  ] $____________. 
 21.2 RISK OF LOSS.  All risk of loss to the Residence, including physical damage or destruction to the Property or 
its improvements due to any cause, except loss caused by a taking in eminent domain, shall be borne by Seller until the 
transaction is closed. 
 
22. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.  Time is of the essence regarding the dates set forth in the REPC. Extensions must be 
agreed to in writing by all parties. Unless otherwise explicitly stated in the REPC:  (a) performance under each Section of 
the REPC which references a date shall absolutely be required by 5:00 PM Mountain Time on the stated date; and (b) the 
term "days" and “calendar days” shall mean calendar days and shall be counted beginning on the day following the event 
which triggers the timing requirement (e.g. Acceptance). Performance dates and times referenced herein shall not be 
binding upon title companies, lenders, appraisers and others not parties to the REPC, except as otherwise agreed to in 
writing by such non-party. 
 
23. ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION AND COUNTERPARTS.  Electronic transmission (including email and fax) of a 
signed copy of the REPC, any addenda and counteroffers, and the retransmission of any signed electronic transmission 
shall be the same as delivery of an original. The REPC and any addenda and counteroffers may be executed in 
counterparts.  
 
24.  CONTRACT DEADLINES.  Buyer and Seller agree that the following deadlines shall apply to the REPC: 
 
 (a) Seller Disclosure Deadline                (Date)   
  
 (b)  Due Diligence Deadline                         (Date) 
  
 (c)  Pre-Construction Meeting Deadline      ____________________________________________________ (Date) 
 
 (d)  Construction Loan Funding Deadline            (Date) 
 
 (e)  Substantial Completion Deadline             (Date) 
 
 (f)  Settlement Deadline                days after the Buyer's receipt of written 
                        Notice of Substantial Completion
