lenders, appraisers and others not parties to this Contract, except as otherwise agreed to in writing by such non-party. 
 
19.  COMPLETE AGREEMENT. This Contract together with its addenda, any attached exhibits, and Landlord Disclosures

interest, including, but not limited to, a family partnership, family trust, limited liability company, partnership, or corporation 
(collectively referred to as a “Permissible Transfer”), shall not be treated as an assignment by Tenant that requires Landlord’s

first page of this Contract shall constitute Landlord’s written consent only for the purpose of conducting a Permissible Transfer.
