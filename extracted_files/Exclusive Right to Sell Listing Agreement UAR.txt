and                                               ( th  e  "Seller").

Seller mutually agree that the Listing Period shall automatically extend until the under-contract transaction closes or is
cancelled.

 2.       BROKERAGE COMPENSATION.
            2.1      Seller's Brokerage Fee.  If, during the Listing Period, the Company, the Seller's Agent, the Seller, another
real estate agent, or anyone else locates a party who is ready, willing and able to buy, lease or exchange (collectively
"acquire") the Property, or any part thereof, at the listing price and terms stated on the Data Form, or any other price
and terms to which the Seller may agree in writing, the Seller has negotiated with and agrees to pay to the Company a
brokerage fee in the amount of           % and $                         o f such gross acquisition price (the "Brokerage
Fee").
            2.2      Seller's Brokerage Fee with an Unrepresented Buyer.  If a buyer is not represented by a brokerage, the
Seller and the Company agree that the Company may have additional liability and responsibilities in the transaction.
Seller agrees that           % and $                         o f the gross acquisition price shall be added to the Brokerage
Fee.
            2.3      Authorization to Offer Compensation to Buyer's Brokerage.  The Company is authorized to advertise or
otherwise communicate that the Seller and/or the Company is offering to pay compensation to a buyer's brokerage in an
amount up to           % or $                         o f the gross acquisition price. If no amount is entered, then the
Company is not authorized to advertise or otherwise communicate that Seller and/or the Company is offering to pay
compensation to a buyer's brokerage. Unless checked below, the Company may enter into a written compensation
agreement to pay a buyer's brokerage not to exceed the authorized amount in this Section 2.3. If the Company agrees
to a written compensation agreement to pay a buyer's brokerage, then the Seller agrees that the Brokerage Fee will be
increased by the amount agreed to in the written compensation agreement.

  [      ] Seller does not authorize the Company to enter into a written compensation agreement with a buyer's brokerage.

            2.4      Seller's Brokerage Fee Due and Payable  The Brokerage Fee, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
Seller and the Company, shall be due and payable from the Seller's proceeds on: (a) If a purchase, the date of
recording of the closing documents for the acquisition of the Property ("Closing"); (b) If a lease, the effective date of the
lease; and (c) if an option, the date consideration for the option agreement is paid. If within the Listing Period, or any
extension of the Listing Period, the Property is withdrawn from sale, transferred, conveyed, leased, rented, or made
unmarketable by a voluntary act of Seller, without the written consent of the Company; or if the sale is prevented by
default of the Seller, the Brokerage Fee shall be immediately due and payable to the Company. BROKERAGE FEES
ARE FULLY NEGOTIABLE AND ARE NOT SET BY LAW, ANY BOARD OR ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS®,
MULTIPLE LISTING SERVICE ("the MLS"), OR IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND
SELLER.

3.       PROTECTION PERIOD.  If within         months after the termination or expiration of this Listing Agreement, the
Property is acquired by any party to whom the Property was offered or shown by the Company, the Seller's Agent, the
Seller, the party's representative, or another real estate agent during the Listing Period, or any extension of the Listing
Period, the Seller agrees to pay to the Company the Brokerage Fee stated in Section 2, unless the Seller is obligated to
pay a Brokerage Fee on such acquisition to another brokerage based on another valid listing agreement entered into
after the expiration or termination date of this Listing Agreement.

4.      SELLER WARRANTIES/DISCLOSURES.  The Seller warrants to the Company that the individuals or entity listed
above as the "Seller" represents all of the record owners of the Property. The Seller warrants that Seller has marketable

Page 1 of 4    Seller's Initials [____________] Date___________________



title and an established right to sell, lease or exchange the Property. The Seller agrees to execute the necessary
documents of conveyance. The Seller agrees to furnish buyer with good and marketable title, and to pay at Settlement,
for a policy of title insurance in accordance with the terms of any real estate purchase contract entered into between
buyer and Seller. The Seller agrees to fully inform the Seller's Agent regarding the Seller's knowledge of the condition of
the Property. Upon signing of this Listing Agreement, the Seller agrees to personally complete and sign a Utah
Association of REALTORS® ("UAR")-approved Seller's Property Condition Disclosure form and a Wire Fraud Alert
Disclosure. The Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller's Agent and the Company against any claims
that may arise from: (a) The Seller providing incorrect or inaccurate information regarding the Property; (b)The Seller
failing to disclose material information regarding the Property, including, but not limited to, the condition of all
appliances; the condition of heating, plumbing, and electrical fixtures and equipment; sewer problems; moisture or other
problems in the roof or foundation; the availability and location of utilities; and the location of property lines; and (c) Any
injuries resulting from any unsafe conditions within the Property.

 5.       AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS.
            5.1      Duties of a Seller's Agent.  By signing this Listing Agreement, the Seller designates the Seller's Agent and
the Principal/Branch Broker for the Company (the "Broker"), as agents for the Seller to locate a buyer for the Property.
The Seller authorizes the Seller's Agent or the Broker to appoint another agent in the Company to also represent the
Seller in the event the Seller's Agent or the Broker will be unavailable to service the Seller. As agents for the Seller, they
have fiduciary duties to the Seller that include loyalty, obedience, full disclosure, confidentiality, reasonable care, and
any other duties required by law.
            5.2      Duties of a Limited Agent.  The Seller understands that the Seller's Agent and the Broker may now, or in
the future, be agents for a buyer who may wish to negotiate a purchase of the Property. Then the Seller's Agent and the
Broker may be acting as Limited Agents - representing both the Seller and buyer at the same time. A Limited Agent has
fiduciary duties to both the Seller and the buyer as required by law. However, some of those duties are "limited" because
the agent cannot provide to both parties undivided loyalty, confidentiality and disclosure. For this reason, the Limited
Agent is bound by a further duty of neutrality. Being neutral, the Limited Agent may not disclose to either party
information likely to weaken the bargaining position of the other – for example, the highest price the buyer will offer, or
the lowest price the Seller will accept. However, the Limited Agent will be required to disclose information given to the
agent in confidence by the other party if failure to disclose such information would be a material misrepresentation
regarding the Property or regarding the ability of the parties to fulfill their obligations. The Seller is advised that neither
the Seller nor the buyer is required to accept a limited agency situation in the Company, and each party is entitled to be
represented by its own agent. In the event a limited agency situation arises, the Seller's Agent and the Broker, as
applicable, may only act as Limited Agents based upon a separate Limited Agency Consent Agreement signed by the
Seller and buyer.

6.      PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.  The Company and the Seller’s Agent are trained in the marketing of real estate.
Neither the Company nor its agents are trained or licensed to provide the Seller or any prospective buyer with legal or
tax advice, or with technical advice regarding the physical condition of the Property. The Seller is advised not to rely on
the Company, or any agents of the Company, for a determination regarding the physical or legal condition of the
Property. If the Seller desires advice regarding: (a) Past or present compliance with zoning and building code
requirements; (b) Legal or tax matters; (c) The physical condition of the Property; (d) This Listing Agreement; or (e) Any
transaction for the acquisition of the Property, the Seller’s Agent and the Company strongly recommend that the Seller
obtain such independent advice. If the Seller fails to do so, the Seller is acting contrary to the advice of the Company.
Any recommendations for third-party services made by the Company or the Seller’s Agent do not guarantee the Seller’s
satisfaction in the use of those third-party services and should not be seen as a warranty of any kind as to the level of
service that will be provided by the third parties. The Seller is advised that it is up to the Seller in the Seller’s sole
discretion to choose third-party services that meet the needs of the Seller and not to rely on any recommendations given
by the Company or the Seller’s Agent.

7.       DISPUTE RESOLUTION.  The parties agree that any dispute, arising prior to or after a Closing, related to this
Listing Agreement, [  ]  SHALL [  ]  MAY AT THE OPTION OF THE PARTIES  first be submitted to mediation. If no box
is checked, then the parties agree that "may at the option of the parties" shall be the default option. Mediation is a
process in which the parties meet with an impartial person who helps to resolve the dispute informally and confidentially.
Mediators cannot impose binding decisions. The parties to the dispute must agree before any settlement is binding. The
parties will jointly appoint an acceptable mediator and share equally in the cost of such mediation. If mediation fails, any
other remedies available at law shall apply. Nothing in this Section 7 prohibits any party from seeking emergency legal
or equitable relief, pending mediation.

8.       ATTORNEY FEES/GOVERNING LAW/CLASS ACTION WAIVER.  Except as provided in Section 7, in case of the
employment of an attorney in any matter arising out of this Listing Agreement solely between the Company and the
Seller, the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the other party all costs and attorney fees, whether the matter
is resolved through court action or otherwise. If, through no fault of the Company, any litigation arises out of the Seller's
employment of the Company under this Listing Agreement (whether before or after a Closing), the Seller agrees to
indemnify the Company and the Seller's Agent from all costs and attorney fees incurred by the Company and/or the
Seller's Agent in pursuing and/or defending such action. This Listing Agreement shall be governed and construed in

Page 2 of 4    Seller's Initials [____________] Date___________________



accordance with the laws of the State of Utah. The Seller forfeits any and all rights to participate in any class action
against the Company. In particular, the Seller agrees not to be a representative or member of any class of claimants or
act as a private attorney general in litigation, arbitration, or administrative proceeding with respect to any claim arising
out of this Listing Agreement.

9.      ADVERTISING/SELLER AUTHORIZATIONS.  The Seller authorizes the Company and the Seller's Agent to
advertise the Property for sale through any printed and/or electronic media deemed necessary and appropriate by the
Seller's Agent and the Company, including, but not limited to, each MLS in which the Company participates. The Seller
agrees that any advertising the Seller intends to conduct, including print and/or electronic media, shall first be approved
in writing by the Seller's Agent. The Seller further agrees that the Seller's Agent and the Company are authorized to:

(c) Obtain financial information from any lender or other party holding a lien or interest on the Property;
(d) Have keys to the Property, if applicable;
(e) Have an MLS or local board of Realtors® approved/endorsed security key-box installed on the Property. If the

Seller authorizes the Broker, or Seller's Agent, to install a non-MLS or local board of Realtors®
approved/endorsed security key-box on the Property, Seller acknowledges that it may not provide the same
level of security as the MLS or local board of Realtors® approved/endorsed security key-box;

(f) Hold Open-Houses at the Property;
(g) Place for sale, sold, or other similar signs ("Signs") on the Property (i.e., the only Signs on the Property shall

be that of the Company);

(i) Order a Home Warranty Plan, if applicable;
(j) Communicate with the Seller for the purpose of soliciting real estate related goods and services during and

safeguarding of personal property and valuables located within the Property. The Seller acknowledges that the
Company is not an insurer against the loss of or damage to personal property. The Seller agrees to hold the Company
harmless from any loss or damage that might result from any authorizations given in Section 9.

Alert Disclosure are incorporated into this Listing Agreement by this reference. There [  ] ARE [  ] ARE NOT additional
terms contained in an Addendum attached to this Listing Agreement. If an Addendum is attached, the terms of that
Addendum are incorporated into this Listing Agreement by this reference.

12.      FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN REAL PROPERTY TAX ACT (“FIRPTA”).  The sale or other disposition of a U.S. real
property interest by a foreign person is subject to income tax withholding under FIRPTA. A “foreign person” may include
a non-resident alien individual, foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust and foreign estate. Seller warrants
and represents to the Company and to the Seller’s Agent, that Seller   [  ]  IS  [  ]  IS NOT a “foreign person” as defined
by the Internal Revenue Code and its associated regulations. If Seller is not a foreign person, Seller agrees, upon
request, to deliver a certification to Buyer at closing, stating that Seller is not a foreign person. This certification shall be
in the form then required by FIRPTA. If FIRPTA applies to you as Seller, you are advised that the Buyer or other
qualified substitute may be legally required to withhold a substantial percentage of the total purchase price for the
Property at closing and remit that amount to the IRS. If Seller is a foreign person as defined above, and Seller does not
have a US Taxpayer Identification number, Seller agrees to prepare to apply for a US Taxpayer Identification number.

13.     EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY.  The Seller and the Company shall comply with Federal, State, and local fair
housing laws.

14.     ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION & COUNTERPARTS.  Electronic transmission (including email and fax) of a

15.      DUE-ON-SALE.  Certain types of transactions may trigger what is commonly referred to as a "due-on-sale"
clause. A "due-on-sale" clause typically states that the Seller's lender or mortgagee may call the loan due and payable

limited to, transactions where: (a) The sale of the property does not result in the underlying debt being paid in full; (b)
The parties enter into a seller-financed transaction; (c) A lease option agreement is entered into; or (d) Any other
unauthorized transfer of title to the Property has occurred without the lender's consent. The Seller understands that if
any underlying encumbrances or mortgages on the Property contain a "due-on-sale clause," and the "due-on-sale"
clause is triggered, the lender may call the entire unpaid balance of the loan immediately due.

Disclosure form, Data Form, a Wire Fraud Alert Disclosure, and any additional addendum, contain the entire agreement
