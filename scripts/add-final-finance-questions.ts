      answer: "A financing method where a new mortgage encompasses an existing mortgage plus additional financing",
      explanation: "A wraparound mortgage is a financing method where a new mortgage encompasses (wraps around) an existing mortgage plus additional financing. The seller continues making payments on the original mortgage while receiving larger payments from the buyer on the wraparound mortgage, profiting from the difference in interest rates. This technique is useful when the original mortgage has a favorable interest rate that the buyer can't obtain in the current market, or when the original mortgage has a due-on-sale clause that would trigger if formally transferred.",

      answer: "A single mortgage that covers multiple properties",
      explanation: "A blanket mortgage is a single financing instrument that covers multiple parcels of real estate. Developers and builders commonly use blanket mortgages to finance several lots or properties simultaneously, providing efficiency and potential cost savings over individual loans. A key feature is the partial release clause, which allows properties to be released from the mortgage lien when sold, without requiring full repayment of the loan. This enables properties to be sold individually while the remaining properties continue to secure the loan.",

      explanation: "Hypothecation is the practice of pledging property as collateral for a loan without transferring possession or title to the lender. In real estate, a mortgage is the most common form of hypothecationâ€”the borrower maintains ownership and use of the property while the lender holds a security interest. If the borrower defaults, the lender can foreclose on the property. This differs from a pledge, which typically involves transferring possession of personal property collateral to the lender during the loan term.",

      explanation: "A recourse loan is one where the borrower is personally liable for the debt beyond the collateral property. If the borrower defaults and the foreclosure sale doesn't satisfy the debt, the lender can pursue the borrower's other assets to recover the deficiency. In contrast, with a non-recourse loan, the lender's recovery is limited to the collateral property, regardless of whether its value covers the outstanding loan amount.

      explanation: "A portfolio loan is a mortgage that the lender keeps in its own investment portfolio rather than selling on the secondary market to entities like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Because these loans aren't sold, they don't need to conform to secondary market requirements. This allows lenders more flexibility in underwriting, potentially benefiting borrowers who don't fit standard qualification criteria (self-employed with variable income, high net worth but low documented income, unique properties, or borrowers with many financed properties).",

      answer: "The process of placing one debt or lien in a lower priority position than another",
      explanation: "Subordination is the process of placing one debt or lien in a lower priority position than another. For example, when refinancing a first mortgage with a home equity line of credit (HELOC) already in place, the HELOC lender may agree to subordinate their lien to remain in second position behind the new first mortgage. Without subordination, the HELOC would automatically move to first position when the original first mortgage is paid off during refinancing, which would be unacceptable to the new first mortgage lender.",

      answer: "A method of calculating interest rebates on prepaid loans that favors the lender by allocating more interest to the early periods of the loan",
      explanation: "The Rule of 78s (also called the 'sum of digits' method) is a formula for calculating interest rebates when a borrower prepays a loan. It weights interest heavily toward the beginning of the loan term, meaning early payoffs result in less interest savings than would occur with simple interest calculations. For example, on a 12-month loan, it allocates 12/78 of the total interest to the first month, 11/78 to the second month, and so on. This method favors lenders and is now restricted for certain loans by federal regulations.",

      explanation: "A yield spread premium (YSP) is compensation paid by lenders to mortgage brokers for originating loans with interest rates higher than the minimum rate the lender would accept. The higher rate provides additional profit to the lender, who shares some with the broker through the YSP. Following the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly restricted YSPs through loan originator compensation rules, limiting brokers' ability to receive compensation based on loan terms like interest rate, to prevent incentives for placing borrowers in unnecessarily expensive loans.",

      answer: "A situation where the loan balance increases because the payments are less than the interest accruing on the loan",
      explanation: "Negative amortization occurs when loan payments are less than the interest accruing on the loan, causing the unpaid interest to be added to the principal balance. This increases the loan balance over time rather than reducing it. Negative amortization can happen with payment option ARMs or other loans with payment caps that limit monthly payment increases. These loans can create payment shock when they eventually recast to fully amortize the larger balance, and can lead to borrowers owing more than they originally borrowed.",

      answer: "An initially low interest rate offered to entice borrowers that typically adjusts to a higher rate after an introductory period",
      explanation: "A teaser rate is an initially low interest rate offered to entice borrowers into adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which typically adjusts to a higher rate after an introductory period of 1-12 months. These rates are often below market and shouldn't be confused with the initial fixed period of a standard ARM (like the first 5 years of a 5/1 ARM).

When a borrower pays off their mortgage, the lender must provide this document, which is then recorded in the county land records to clear the title.

      explanation: "Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is insurance that protects the lender if a borrower defaults on a conventional loan with a down payment less than 20%. The borrower pays the premiums, but the coverage benefits the lender by reducing their risk. By law, PMI must be automatically terminated when the loan balance reaches 78% of the original value, and borrowers can request cancellation at 80% LTV.

A due-on-sale clause (also called an alienation clause) in a mortgage gives the lender the right to demand full repayment of the loan when the property is sold or transferred.

      explanation: "Discount points are upfront fees paid to the lender at closing to reduce the interest rate on a mortgage. Each point costs 1% of the loan amount and typically lowers the rate by 0.25%. For example, on a $300,000 loan, one point would cost $3,000.

Lenders charging usurious rates can face penalties including forfeiture of interest, return of excess interest, or in some cases, forfeiture of principal.
