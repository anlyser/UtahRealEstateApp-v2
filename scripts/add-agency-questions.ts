      answer: "Let the buyer beware",
      explanation: "Caveat emptor is a Latin phrase meaning 'let the buyer beware.' It suggests that buyers should inspect properties carefully before purchasing, as they assume responsibility for the property's condition. While disclosure laws have mitigated this principle, buyers should still thoroughly investigate properties, as sellers aren't obligated to disclose non-material facts.",

      explanation: "A client has an agency relationship with the agent, who provides fiduciary duties (loyalty, confidentiality, disclosure, obedience, reasonable care, and accounting).

      explanation: "A latent defect is a hidden flaw in a property that is not discoverable through reasonable inspection by the buyer or their representative. Examples include foundation issues behind walls, termite damage in inaccessible areas, or underground water problems.

      explanation: "Puffing statements are exaggerated opinions, sales talk, or hyperbole that don't constitute material facts. Examples include 'best neighborhood in town' or 'most beautiful view.' These statements aren't considered misrepresentation because they're subjective opinions rather than factual claims, and reasonable people don't rely on them for decision-making.",

      explanation: "Procuring cause refers to the agent whose actions were the predominant, direct, and effective reason the sale occurred. In commission disputes, procuring cause determines which agent deserves the commission.

      explanation: "A net listing is an arrangement where the broker's commission is everything above a specified net amount the seller wants to receive. For example, if the seller wants $200,000 net and the property sells for $220,000, the broker receives $20,000.

      answer: "A listing where the broker gets paid regardless of who finds the buyer, including the seller",
      explanation: "An exclusive right to sell listing guarantees the broker a commission regardless of who finds the buyerâ€”even if the seller finds a buyer independently. This is the most common listing type, providing the strongest protection for the listing broker's commission. It incentivizes the broker to market the property extensively since their commission is secured.",

      explanation: "In an exclusive agency listing, the listing broker gets paid if any broker finds a buyer, but not if the seller finds a buyer independently. This differs from an exclusive right to sell listing, where the broker gets paid regardless of who finds the buyer.

      answer: "A non-exclusive listing where any broker who brings a buyer gets the commission",
      explanation: "An open listing is non-exclusive, allowing the seller to list with multiple brokers simultaneously and pay a commission only to the broker who actually sells the property. The seller also reserves the right to sell the property themselves without owing any commission. Open listings are rarely used by brokers because they provide minimal commission security.",

      answer: "Mixing client funds with personal or business funds",
      explanation: "Commingling is the unethical and often illegal practice of mixing client funds (like earnest money deposits) with an agent's personal or brokerage funds. Real estate professionals must maintain separate trust or escrow accounts for client funds. Commingling is a serious violation of fiduciary duty and can result in license suspension or revocation.",

      answer: "The illegal use of client funds for personal purposes",
      explanation: "Conversion is the illegal and unethical misappropriation or theft of client funds for personal use. It's a step beyond commingling, where the agent actually uses the client's money. Conversion is a serious breach of fiduciary duty and typically results in license revocation, potential criminal charges, and civil liability.",

      answer: "Laws that prohibit anti-competitive behavior like price fixing",
      explanation: "Antitrust laws prohibit business practices that reduce competition and harm consumers. In real estate, antitrust violations include commission price fixing (brokers agreeing on standard rates), market allocation (dividing territories), group boycotts (refusing to cooperate with certain firms), and tying arrangements (forcing purchase of one service to get another).",

      explanation: "Subagency is an agency relationship where an agent working with a buyer is legally an agent of the seller, owing fiduciary duties to the seller, not the buyer. This creates a situation where both the listing agent and the subagent represent the seller's interests.

      answer: "An agency relationship where the agent has a financial interest in the property",
      explanation: "Agency coupled with an interest occurs when an agent has a personal financial interest in the property being sold. This creates a special type of agency that cannot be revoked by the principal.
