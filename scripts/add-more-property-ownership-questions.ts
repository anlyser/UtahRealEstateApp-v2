      explanation: "The key difference between joint tenancy and tenancy in common is that joint tenancy includes rights of survivorship, while tenancy in common does not. In joint tenancy, when one owner dies, their interest automatically transfers to the surviving owners. In tenancy in common, each owner can will their share to anyone. Additionally, joint tenancy requires the four unities (time, title, interest, and possession), while tenancy in common allows owners to have different ownership percentages acquired at different times.",

The life tenant has the right to use, possess, and even rent the property, but cannot sell it or destroy its value.

This power, based on the Fifth Amendment's 'takings clause,' enables essential public projects like highways, schools, and utilities. For a taking to be legal, it must: 1) Be for public use/benefit (broadly interpreted in recent years); 2) Provide just compensation (typically fair market value); and 3) Follow due process.

It represents the owner's bundle of rights, including the rights to use, possess, sell, lease, and exclude others from the property. Unlike physical documents like a deed (which is evidence of title transfer), title is the abstract concept of ownership itself.

It is based on the principle that property should never be without ownership, and when no private owner exists, the state becomes the owner.

It establishes that those who first put water to beneficial use have priority rights to it, regardless of their proximity to the water source.
