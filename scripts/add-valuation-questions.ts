      explanation: "The principle of conformity states that maximum value is realized when a property is in harmony with its surroundings.

      explanation: "The principle of regression states that a higher-value property will be negatively affected (decreased in value) by the presence of nearby lower-value properties.

      answer: "When interest rates rise, property values tend to decrease",
      explanation: "Generally, when interest rates rise, property values tend to decrease, and when interest rates fall, property values tend to increase. This is because higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, reducing the amount buyers can afford to spend on properties, which puts downward pressure on prices.",

      answer: "To accelerate depreciation deductions for tax purposes",
      explanation: "Declining balance depreciation is an accelerated depreciation method that allows larger deductions in the earlier years of an asset's life and smaller deductions in later years. In real estate, this method can be used for tax purposes to frontload depreciation deductions, potentially providing greater tax benefits in the early years of ownership.",
